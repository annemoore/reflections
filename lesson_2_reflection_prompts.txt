What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder turns into a git repository where you can save commits. You need
to do it to save versions of the files in the folder and presumably to share
them with others through github.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate place where you can place files from the
working directory before committing them to the repository. It allows you to not
save all files in the working directory to a single commit. It also lets you
slowly choose the files you want to place in a commit rather than choose them
all at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
